Build a sleek, minimalist website for a creative studio called Fireworks (URL: www.fwrks.com).

Design Guidelines:

Inspired by Apple’s design aesthetic: minimalist, clean, bold

Use black and white only (no colour accents)

Font: Use SF Display for headings, SF Pro Text for body (or the closest web-safe alternative)

Smooth transitions between sections (one flows into the next seamlessly)

Use soft animations (fade-ins, smooth scroll), not flashy effects

Mobile responsive

Website Sections (in order):

1. Hero Section

Black background

Centered bold white text:

Don’t build a brand. Build a movement.
Fireworks helps visionaries turn ideas into movements.

Subtle animation (e.g. glowing fuse line or fire spark)

2. What We Do

White background, black text

Title: “What We Do”

Subtitle: We help brands:

4 points, staggered on scroll:

Craft compelling narratives that resonate

Design strategic experiences that connect

Build communities that move with purpose

Launch movements that outlive trends

Optional: fade-in animation for each point

3. How We Do It

Light grey or white background

Title: “How We Do It”

Subtitle: Through a collaborative process that blends:

4 key pillars, each in its own block or column:

Experience Design — Create experiences people never forget

Movement Building — From launch to legacy, we help you scale your vision
